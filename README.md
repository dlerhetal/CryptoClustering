# CryptoClustering

Module 19 Challenge for Vanderbilt Data Analytics January 2024

There are 3 files and 1 folder located in this repository, as follows:

This README file is in the main directory with Crypto_Clustering.ipynb, and crypto_market_data.csv is located in the Resources folder.

Special Recognition: Ahmad Mousa is as passionate and caring as he is knowledgeable, and Joshua Steier never hesitates to help walk us through challenges, but this time around it was my peer Karson Kosek (responding to a question from another student Joshua Gibson) who came through holoviz.org/tutorial/Composing_Plots.html for the final 2 steps in the project: visualizing the composite charts.

I always do participate in office hours and study groups while working on projects with collaborators including but not necessarily limited to the following peers: Ilknur Sekmen, Justin Ibeh, Karson Kosek, Kiara Shannon, Luisa Dinwiddie, Margo Berry, Morgan Escue, Morgan Foge, Nathan Johnson, William Brewer, Andrew Clifft, Angela Reed, and Josh Gibson, and I did spend my time in stackoverflow.com, w3schools.com, geeksforgeeks.com, github.com, and bing's new copilot whom I currently consider > google ai; however, the bootcamp has added a new Xpert Learning Assistant, and my life is now complete. Thank you for this resource!
